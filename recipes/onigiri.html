    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of Japanese short-grain rice</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups of water</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons of rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>Filling of your choice (pickled plums, salmon, tuna, seaweed, etc.)</li>
        <li>Optional: Nori (seaweed) sheets, sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Drain the rice in a colander for 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, combine the rice and water and bring to a boil. 
            Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for 12-15 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until the sugar and salt are dissolved.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large bowl and add the vinegar mixture. Mix gently until the rice is coated evenly with the mixture.</li>
        <li>Wet your hands with water and sprinkle some salt on them. Take a small amount of rice and form it into a ball, about the size of a small apple.</li>
        <li>Make a small indentation in the middle of the ball with your thumb and add a small amount of filling (pickled plums, salmon, tuna, seaweed, etc.).</li>
        <li>Cover the filling with more rice and shape the ball into a triangle or oval shape.</li>
        <li>Optional: wrap the onigiri with a sheet of nori and sprinkle sesame seeds on top.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process until all the rice and filling is used up.</li>
        <li>Serve the onigiri immediately, or store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a day. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
