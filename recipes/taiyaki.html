        <li>Top with another tablespoon of batter to cover the filling.</li>
        <li>Close the lid and cook for 2-3 minutes or until the Taiyaki is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the Taiyaki from the mold and place it on a wire rack to cool.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process until all the batter and filling is used up.</li>
        <li>Optional: sprinkle some chocolate chips or matcha powder on top of the Taiyaki before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve the Taiyaki warm and enjoy!</li>
